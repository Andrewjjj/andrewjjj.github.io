# Pathfinding-Visualizer
Pathfinding Visualizer

## Introduction
This version is a bit different than the one in the development repository in the sense that, this one is pure javascript whereas the one in 'Pathfinding / Maze Algorithm Visualizer' has some code to run the server as well.

## Currently implemented algorithms:
### Search:
- Bredth-First Search
- Depth-First Search with some newly implemented algorithm for finding shortest-path
- Dijkstra's Algorithm (Unweighted)
- Bidirectional Bredth-First Search

### Maze:
- Recursive Backtracker (Depth-First Search) Maze Generation Algorithm
- Randomized Kruskal's Maze Generation Algorithm
- Randomized Prim's Maze Generation Algorithm
- Eller's Maze Generation Algorithm
