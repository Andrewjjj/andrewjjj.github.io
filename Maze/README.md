# Pathfinding / Maze-Generation Algorithm Visualizer
Pathfinding Visualizer

## Introduction
First of all, I would like to give thanks and give credit to Cl√©ment Mihailescu for getting me started on this project idea.
Although the foundational idea of this project is not originally from me, but all the code original and written solely by me.

This version is a bit different than the one in the development repository in the sense that, this one is pure javascript whereas the one in 'Pathfinding / Maze Algorithm Visualizer' has some code to run the server as well.

## Currently implemented algorithms:
### Search:
- Bredth-First Search
- Depth-First Search with some newly implemented algorithm for finding shortest-path
- Dijkstra's Algorithm (Unweighted)
- Bidirectional Bredth-First Search

### Maze:
- Recursive Backtracker (Depth-First Search) Maze Generation Algorithm
- Randomized Kruskal's Maze Generation Algorithm
- Randomized Prim's Maze Generation Algorithm
- Eller's Maze Generation Algorithm
